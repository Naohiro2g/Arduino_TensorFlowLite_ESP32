# Arduino_TensorFlowLite_ESP32

https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers/overview

## Overview

This library runs TensorFlow machine learning models on microcontrollers, allowing you to build AI/ML applications powered by deep learning and neural networks. 

With the included examples, you can recognize speech, detect people using a camera, and recognise "magic wand" gestures using an accelerometer.

The examples work best with the M5StickC(ESP32) board, which has a microphone and accelerometer.
